# Overview

This purpose of this project is to develop a customer banking system utilizing Python scripting. This system enables users to efficiently manage their savings and Certificate of Deposit (CD) accounts. It streamlines the process of inputting account specifics such as balances, interest rates, and durations, thereafter automatically computing interest earned and updating account balances accordingly.

# Files Summary

1. Accounts.py: Contains the Account class with methods for setting balance and interest.

2. savings_account.py: Implements the create_savings_account function. This function creates a savings account instance, calculates interest earned based on user input, updates the account balance with earned interest, and returns the updated balance and interest earned.

3. cd_account.py: Implements the create_cd_account function. This function creates a CD account instance, calculates interest earned based on user input, updates the account balance with earned interest, and returns the updated balance and interest earned.

4. customer_banking.py: Implements the main functionality. It imports create_savings_account and create_cd_account functions, prompts users to input account details, calls the appropriate functions to calculate interest and update balances, and displays the results. Additionally, 'get_valid_input(prompt)' ensures valid user input by handling spaces, commas, and providing error messages for invalid inputs.
